The CellProfiler Analyst project is developed in Python and tested under Mac 
OSX 10.5, Windows XP, and to a lesser extent some versions of Linux.

Code may be checked out from our SVN repository here:
https://svn.broadinstitute.org/CellProfiler/trunk/CPAnalyst/


To run the developer version, you will need Python 2.5 and the following python 
packages:

 - wx 2.8.10
 - MySQLdb 1.2.2
 - pysqlite2 (if using SQLite)
 - numpy 1.3
 - scipy 0.7
 - matplotlib 0.98 (for plotting functionality)
 - PIL


OPTIONAL: Classifier can be sped up by installing the user-defined function
found in mysql_plugins/classify.c. To add this function to MySQL, compile 
classify.c to classify.so, and put this in a directory on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
for MySQL, then execute this statement within MySQL:
mysql> CREATE FUNCTION classifier RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'classify.so';


CellProfiler Analyst can be run from a terminal as follows:

 python CPAnalyst/src/cpa.py
